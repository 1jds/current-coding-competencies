# Current Coding Competencies

A Pen created on CodePen.io. See the 'full view' at this address: [https://codepen.io/Abrogated/full/eYPPmYZ](https://codepen.io/Abrogated/full/eYPPmYZ).

See the 'editor view' [HERE](https://codepen.io/Abrogated/pen/eYPPmYZ).

This repo contains the code for a small page that was made to visually display my current coding competencies in a number of languages and frameworks (as well as to practice Vue). It is not meant to be exhaustive.
